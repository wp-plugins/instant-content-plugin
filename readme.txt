Loads content pages or posts from a zipped collection of text files. Includes sample databases of 325 business letters.

== Description ==
Adds new content as Posts or Pages from an archive of text files. Interesting archives can be found on the support website.

I've been using this plugin to add pages to my websites as I convert to WordPress. I find it easy to create text files where the first line of the text file is title of the page and the rest is the content. My procedure was to strip the html from my old static pages leaving just the content. I then zip the file and upload it to the Instant Content directory where the plugin loads the data.

The plugin adds a link to the Pages and Posts menu in order to "Add instant Content".

The zip files in the plugin directory appear in a drop down box. Select the one to load.

Pages: 

Opptionally you can select a parent page for the new content from a dropdown box of all of your existing pages. If you don't have any pages, the dropdown will not display.

If you like, you can create a new page that will have links to all of your new content. If you type in the title of a new page, that page will be created and updated with links to the new content. The content will be child pages to this new page.

Posts:

You can set a date in the future for posts and an interval for posting. Enter a start date. Then select a frequency such as "every other day" for the interval of postings. Since some of the sample databases are hundreds of entries, so you can have fresh data for years to come.

Important!

Backup your database first. The sample zips add a whole lot of content and it is a pain to delete them by hand if you don't like what you get. There may be a bug in WordPress 3.0 that limits the number of trash entries that can be emptied, so please backup your db before adding content that you are not sure that you want.

Don't add the content twice without getting rid of the old data, this just adds duplicate pages.

I have a dozen or so odd databases of content that may be interesting to some people who need instant content on their web sites, and I will make these available if there is any interest. Check my website http://www.blogseye.com for instant content zip files.

For those of you who do not have zip at your hosting company, the plugin uses a zip hack that emulates zip using only gzip functions.
